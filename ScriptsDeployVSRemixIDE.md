# Use The Scripts To Deploy VS Use Remix

Is this script similar to the Deploy button in the Remix online editor?

Yes, the script you've written serves a similar purpose to the Deploy button in the Remix online editor. Here are the similarities and differences:

## Similarities

Deployment Functionality: Both the script and the Deploy button in Remix are used to deploy smart contracts to the blockchain.
Automated Contract Deployment: The script automates the deployment process, similar to what happens when you use the Deploy button in Remix.

## Differences

### Environment

- Remix: A web-based IDE that allows for quick prototyping and deployment directly from the browser.
- Foundry Script: A local environment that provides more control over the deployment process, making it more suitable for larger projects and automated workflows.

### Automation and Scripting

- Remix: Deployment is done manually through the UI.
- Foundry Script: Deployment is automated and can be integrated into continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, making it ideal for professional development environments.

### Broadcast Control

- Remix: The deployment process is straightforward with fewer steps.
- Foundry Script: You have more control over the broadcast process with functions like vm.startBroadcast() and vm.stopBroadcast(), allowing for more complex deployment logic if needed.

## Using Foundry Script

Running your deployment script with Foundry involves using a command-line interface (CLI), as shown before:

```bash
forge script path/to/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol --broadcast --rpc-url <YOUR_RPC_URL>
```

This command will compile your contracts, execute the script, and broadcast the transaction to the specified network, similar to what happens when you click the Deploy button in Remix but with more control and automation options.
