# Explanation Of The Script DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol

Here's a brief explanation of what each part of your script does:

## License Declaration

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: SEE LICENSE IN LICENSE
```

This line specifies the license for your Solidity file. It's good practice to include this for legal reasons.

## Solidity Version Pragma

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.19 <0.8.26;
```

This line specifies the version of Solidity to be used for this contract. It ensures that the contract is compiled with a version of Solidity between 0.8.19 (inclusive) and 0.8.26 (exclusive).

## Imports

```solidity
import {Script} from "forge-std/Script.sol";
import {SimpleStorage} from "../src/SimpleStorage.sol";
```

Script is imported from the forge-std library, which provides utilities for writing deployment scripts.
SimpleStorage is imported from your project's source directory, indicating the contract you want to deploy.

## DeploySimpleStorage Contract

```solidity
contract DeploySimpleStorage is Script {
    function run() external returns (SimpleStorage) {
        vm.startBroadcast();
        SimpleStorage simpleStorage = new SimpleStorage();
        vm.stopBroadcast();
        return simpleStorage;
    }
}
```

This contract inherits from Script, providing access to Foundry's scripting utilities.
The run function is defined as external, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.
vm.startBroadcast() and vm.stopBroadcast() are used to signal the start and end of a transaction broadcast. This tells Foundry to send transactions to the network.
A new instance of SimpleStorage is created and deployed.
The deployed SimpleStorage instance is returned.

## Running the Script

To run this script and deploy your SimpleStorage contract, you would typically use the Foundry command:

```bash
forge script path/to/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol --broadcast --rpc-url <YOUR_RPC_URL>
```

Replace path/to/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol with the actual path to your deployment script, and <YOUR_RPC_URL> with the RPC URL of the network you are deploying to (e.g., a local testnet, a public testnet, or the mainnet).
